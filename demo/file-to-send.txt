This is just a file to be sent. Also some of my complain about this homework.

Since our lecture teacher and ta don't have any anti-cheating mechanism and the homework has never changed for a long time,
almost every students "learned from" other previous students' homework, while teacher and ta will say nothing about this.

On the other hands, the homework code will be judged by ta's taste, it is to say, there is no standard answer or some other
machanism to say why a student gets better score than anthor student.
In algorithm lecture, every students should pass OJ tests. Obviously students can cheat since the lack of plagiarism, but
students are juedged in a very objective standard.
However, for this homework, you can be "LAZY". It's ok not to achieve packet corruption, it's ok not to simulate real web env,
it's ok not do any test and you can SAY LOUDLY that you are right --- anyway ta won't be strict (they may not try to run your 
code), why you so serious?

I think, this is a kind of, bully honest people.
No one needs "correct" implementation, ta and teacher don't give it a shit. So students don't give it a shit. They just copy-paste
previous students' code, and get a good score they want. The code? Why bother? It has always been the case!
But, is it right that this has always been the case? Is it right that students in school are not care about the knowledge and
programming skill, but spend their time on FUCKING score and homework report?
